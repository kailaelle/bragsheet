```

## Create HTML and CSS

### Open your folder in Sublime Text
 - open Sublime and select File, Open...
 - Select the folder you just created for your repo
 - create HTML and CSS files in sublime, they can be saved directly to your folder

### Set up your HTML

- create div tags and other elements to setup your page
- add photos, links to other websites and any else you'd like to include
